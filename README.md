# Ably OpenAPI specifications

This repository contains an OAS3 specification for the [Ably REST API](https://ably.com/documentation/rest-api). In the future additional specifications will be added here.

## Ably client library SDKs

Ably provides official client library SDKs developed by Ably that offer a consistent yet idiomatic API across every language. Ably recommends that customers use our comprehensive native SDKs to consume our REST APIs. Download an SDK at [ably.com/download](https://ably.com/download).

If you wish to access the raw REST API however, Ably does provide an OpenAPI and Swagger compatible specification in this repository in [swagger.yaml](./swagger.yaml).
